<h3> Abstract: </h3>
This work shows how we deploy deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods in
a challenging air-hockey environment. We analyze the sub-tasks present in the
environment and propose a composite agent that consists of five learning-based
sub-agents governed by a hand-crafted state machine. Additionally, we analyze the
physical constraints and suggest careful reward-shaping to overcome those. Finally,
we show the techniques that we used to reduce the sim-to-real gap challenges
modeled in the evaluation environment.
